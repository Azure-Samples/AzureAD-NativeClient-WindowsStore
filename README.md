=========================

This sample demonstrates a Windows Store application calling a web API that is secured using Azure AD.  The Windows Store application uses the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) to obtain a JWT access token through the OAuth 2.0 protocol.  The access token is sent to the web API to authenticate the user.
